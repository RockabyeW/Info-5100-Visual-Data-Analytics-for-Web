        Problem 1. For each of the following items in the list, please:
        <br>A: Identify whether it is a canonical Javascript type
        <br>B: If the type is a canonical Javascript type, please provide an example in your script
        <br>section using console.log(typeof( ... )).
        <br>C: If applicable, identify any unusual or unexpected typeof() behavior for the type.
        <br>(do this whether or not it is a canonical JS type if it is applicable)
        <br>a) dingus; b) array; c) boolean; d) int; e) number; f) class;
        <br>g) regex; h) string; i) Unicode; j) object; k) null; l) function;
        <br>m) NaN (not a number); n) char; o) pointer; p) undefined;
    <script>
            //A.answer
            document.write("<br>A.Anser:<br>Only c),e),h),k),p) are canonical Javascript type")
           //B.answer
            document.write('<br>B.anser is in console')
            console.log(typeof(true))
            console.log(typeof(1))
            console.log(typeof("abc"))
            console.log(typeof(null))//it should be null but it is output as object
            console.log(typeof(undefined))
           //C.answer
            document.write('<br>C.anser:')
            let a = [1,2,3]
            console.log(typeof(a)) //it should be array but it is output as object
            console.log(typeof(1)) //it should be int but it is output as number
            class b {}
            console.log(typeof(b))//it should be class but it is output as function
            console.log(typeof(NaN))//it should be NaN but it is output as number
            console.log(typeof('c'))///it should be char but it is output as string
            console.log(typeof(null)) //it should be null but it is output as object
                                    //it should be Unicode but it is output as string

        <br>Problem 2. First, in 1-2 sentences, please define type coercion. Then, in your <p> tag please provide
            two examples where type coercion produces an answer that is unusual or unexpected (i.e.
            different from Python output or a case where Python would throw an exception). For each
            sample, briefly explain why it is unexpected. Then, in the script section put both of your
            code examples into of a console.log() statement so we can see the result (e.g.
            console.log("apple" + "orange") )
            
        <br>Answer:
        <br>Type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another (such as string to number, object to boolean, and so on).
        <br>eg1:True + 1 ; True is a boolean, and 1 is a number. It could have cause error in Python but it can be calculated as 2 in JS;
            eg2:"aofihwoeifh"+1; "aofihwoeifh" is a String, and 1 is a number. It could have cause error in Python but it can be output as aofihwoeifh1 in JS;
        <script>
            console.log(true+1)
            console.log("aofihwoeifh"+1)
        </script>
    </p>

        Problem 3. In your script tag, create a recursive function, fact( n ), which takes an integer, n,
            as an argument and returns the factorial of n. Do not use loops or the built-in factorial
            functions to accomplish this. Remember that recursion involves two major components:
            base case(s) and recursive calls of the same function.
            Make sure that your fact function handles negative integers by returning undefined,
            properly returns 1 for fact( 0 ), and otherwise uses recursion to compute correct
            factorials for larger integers.
            Include the following code block after your function to prove it works as expected:
            console.log( fact(-2) );
            console.log( fact(0) );
            console.log( fact(1) );
            console.log( fact(5) );
            console.log( fact(12) );
            (As the function is only intended to handle integers, do not worry about implementing the
            gamma function for decimal numbers)
        <br>
        <script>
            function  fact(n){
                if(n>0){
                    if(n==1) return 1
                    return fact(n-1)*n
                }
                else return 1
            }
            console.log( fact(-2) );
            console.log( fact(0) );
            console.log( fact(1) );
            console.log( fact(5) );
            console.log( fact(12) );
        </script>
    </p>

        4. Describe, in your own words, the course policy on late and unreadable work outlined in
        the syllabus, which is linked from the course website.
        <br><br>Answerï¼š
        <br>Every late work gets 0 points. An unzipped or unauthorized file or commit without a key file will not receive 0 by example. 
        <br>This includes the fact that we have submitted the correct document, but if we actually forgot the document or submitted our previous homework. 
        <br>In order to avoid zero points, we must redownload and verify the commit in CMS. We will receive a total of 5 days of sliding days as an extension of the deadline. 
        <br>The minimum two homework scores will be removed.
    </p>
